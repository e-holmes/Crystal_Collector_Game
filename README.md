**How to use this app**
Take a loot at the page, find where it says "Magic" this is going to tell you what number you are trying to get to. Now find where it says "User Magic" this will tell you how much magic you have collected. Now you can start collecting magic by clicking on the crystals. Each crystal is worth a random amount of magic. You need to figure out how much each crystal is worth and add up to the total Magic you need. Once you hit the correct amount or go over it, the game will reset and the crystals will be worth a new amount!
